# solver16.py : Solve the 16 puzzle problem - upto 3 tiles to move.

# (1)   
# State space: All possible formulation of the tiles in 16 puzzle problem.
# For example, a sample of the state look like this,
# S0 = array([[ 2,  3,  0,  4],
#             [ 1,  6,  7,  8],
#             [ 5, 10, 11, 12],
#             [ 9, 13, 14, 15]])
#
# Successor function: Possible position of the tiles after 1 move (either moving 1, 2, or 3 tiles at ones)
# I marked the each successor function with its appropriate move with the 3 character notation.
# 
# >>> successor(S0)

#          [ 5, 10, 11, 12],
#          [ 9, 13, 14, 15]]), 'L13')]
# 
# Edge weights: 1 (One valid move is calculated as cost of 1)
#
# Goal state: Following is the goal state
#
# array([[ 1,  2,  3,  4],
#        [ 5,  6,  7,  8],
#        [ 9, 10, 11, 12],
#        [13, 14, 15,  0]])

# Heuristic function: (Sum of Manhattan cost) / 3
# 
# If I use the sum of the Manhattan cost as in the notes, it would be not admissble due to the over-estimating.
# I can move the tiles upto 3, which means that Dividing the sum of Manhattan cost by 3 won't over-estimate.
# Hence, this huristic function is admissible.
# Also, it is consistent, because it meets the triangle inequality.
#
# (2) How the search algorithm work
#
# When the search starts, the algorithm finds looks up for the successors that has the lowest heuristic value.
# Then, for each step, the algorithm finds the state with the minimum heuristic value in the fringe, branching that node.
# It keeps branching until it reaches the goal state.
#
# (3) Any problem I faced, assumptions, simplifications, design decisions
#
# The problem was straight forward, I didn't have to make any assumptions or simplifications.
